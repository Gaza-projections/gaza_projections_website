      <h2 class="text-h2 text-white">Welcome to Our Project</h2>
      <p class="text-body-1 text-white">
        The current Israel-Gaza war, which began on 7 October 2023, has had an immense humanitarian impact. As of 31 May
        2024, at least 36,284 Palestinians were killed and 82,057 were injured in Gaza, according to MoH in Gaza. In
        Israel the conflict has resulted in the deaths of over 1,500 people and 8,730 injured, while 124 hostages still
        remain in Gaza. Approximately 85% of the 2.2 million Palestinians are displaced, and most reside in overcrowded
        shelters with limited access to water, sanitation and food. The provision of health care in Gaza is extremely
        limited.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body-1 text-white">
        <b>For our first report</b> (published on 19 February 2024), our group developed models to project excess
        deaths, both direct (trauma-related) and indirect that may occur in Gaza over the six-month period from 7
        February 2024 to 6 August 2024. Alternative projections have been developed for each of three scenarios: 1)
        ceasefire, 2) continuation of conditions experienced between 7 October 2023 to 15 January 2024, termed “status
        quo,”; and 3) further escalation of the war, termed “escalation”. The projections are stratified by sub- period,
        age and category of proximal causes of death, including traumatic injuries, infectious diseases, maternal and
        neonatal causes (i.e. infants less than 28 days old) and non-communicable diseases.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body-1 text-white">
        <b>For our second report</b> (published on 5 June 2024), our group developed a scenario- based model to provide
        a plausible projection of the number of <u>traumatic injury deaths</u> that could occur in the Rafah governorate
        over the coming 90 days (20 May - 17 August 2024) so that policymakers and humanitarians can make sound,
        evidence-based decisions.
